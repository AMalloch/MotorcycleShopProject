Little note for the future should either of us return to this project. Damned shame as looking over the planning we actually had a "soldItem" class but for some reason we removed it, I think because of the initial way we planned it with just ID's rather than composition caused a'lot of confusion(face palm). Anyway StockItem has two responsibility's because of the quantity's so split that into two classes i.e StockItem has a quantity and CartItem will have a StockItem its own Quantity and a customer. Also as a refactor move functions in the classes using DBHelper methods into the DBHelper and split up some of the later DBHelper methods i.e delete from basket.
